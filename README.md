Getting started with Github

Hello there!

I am excited to get started using Github!  I'm looking forward to keeping my code versions more organized, and making it easier to share with my collaborators.  

I've been learning lots of pandas, geopandas, and pysal the last few weeks, which has been fantastic.  I love making beautiful maps and plots that help the others in my group visualize the data that we are working with.

I also love gardening, cooking, baking, reading, running, violin, piano, watersports, and winter sports!

Don't forget about the teddy bears.  They are also important.
